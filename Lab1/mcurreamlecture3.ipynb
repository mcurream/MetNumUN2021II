Now, knowing whether your array contains `nan` values is all well and good, but how do we remove `nan`s? Handily enough, NumPy arrays can be indexed by boolean values (`True` or `False`). If we use a boolean array to index an array, we will remove all values of the array that register as `False` under the condition. We use the `isnan()` function in create a boolean array, assigning a `True` value to everything that is *not* `nan` and a `False` to the `nan`s and we use that to index the same array."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LqA4klLRbkoe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615324023057,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":384,"user":{"displayName":"Miguel Currea Moncaleano","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibC8ZeeXLVDkWXuBiXa7s9iFOFoOn87zJXVmmdZQ=s64","userId":"12702477127813930937"}},"outputId":"1e1943d5-b6c1-44a6-c41a-66bc2c47823a"},"source":["ix = ~np.isnan(v) # the ~ indicates a logical not, inverting the bools\n","print(v[ix])  # We can also just write v = v[~np.isnan(v)]"],"execution_count":62,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[1. 2. 4. 5.]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sCVvuS-Qbkoe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615324040651,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":410,"user":{"displayName":"Miguel Currea Moncaleano","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibC8ZeeXLVDkWXuBiXa7s9iFOFoOn87zJXVmmdZQ=s64","userId":"12702477127813930937"}},"outputId":"57823931-4eb7-4e56-d627-3ac5a0f0e62b"},"source":["print(np.mean(v[ix])) "],"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["3.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lgw4rXNEbkoe"},"source":["There are a few shortcuts to this process in the form of NumPy functions specifically built to handle them, such as `nanmean()`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iEKqj-Dabkoe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615324082473,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":344,"user":{"displayName":"Miguel Currea Moncaleano","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GibC8ZeeXLVDkWXuBiXa7s9iFOFoOn87zJXVmmdZQ=s64","userId":"12702477127813930937"}},"outputId":"b1697630-afd4-4434-ac99-be1d99c88ebb"},"source":["print(np.nanmean(v)) "],"execution_count":64,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["3.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LMN1rzCFbkoe"},"source":["The `nanmean()` function simply calculates the mean of the array as if there were no `nan` values at all!

Linear algebra comes down to the multiplication and composition of scalar and matrix values. A scalar value is just a real number that we multiply against an array. When we scale a matrix or array using a scalar, we multiply each individual element of that matrix or array by the scalar.\n","\n","A matrix is a collection of values, typically represented by an $m \\times n$ grid, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The edge lengths $m$ and $n$ do not necessarily have to be different. If we have $m = n$, we call this a square matrix. A particularly interesting case of a matrix is when $m = 1$ or $n = 1$. In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$. For the purpose of this section, we will be using matrix and array interchangeably.\n","\n","We can express the matrix equation as:\n","\n","$$ y = A\\cdot x $$\n","\n","Where $A$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix, $y$ is a $m \\times 1$ vector, and $x$ is a $n \\times 1$ vector.

This requires a little bit more clarification, lest we think that we can go about multiplying any matrices by any other matrices.\n","\n","#### Matrix multiplication\n","\n","With matrix multiplication, the order in which the matrices are multiplied matters.
